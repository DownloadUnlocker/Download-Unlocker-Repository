# Download-Unlocker-Repository

## Update: Download Unlocker's Internal Systems have officially shut down on July 11th, 2021.
After closing our main servers on May 27th, we announced ahead of time that our support systems, employee networks, partner portal, and other internal servers will remain open for any last-minute inquiries until July 11th, 2021. After this, we will be laying off all of our employees and disabling our internal hardware.

An archive of all of our data will continue to remain available for legal purposes, however this archive is being handed off to an appropriate archival company. This is our last place to say goodbye, so we want to, for one last time, say thanks to everyone who made Download Unlocker amazing, and we hope to someday have you enjoying our future products.

As far as the source code goes, we no longer have any developers to work on it, so we are officially abandoning it. We sincerely apologize for this cancellation, but we have to consider the circumstances we are currently in and unfortunately it is just not possible for us to continue paying developers to rewrite our source code for public usage.

Maybe down the line we will come back to it, but as another company.

That's all I have for you guys. Take care.

## Update: Download Unlocker has officially closed on May 27th, 2021.
We understand that many of you are frusturated that we still have not released the source code for our projects, and I assure you that this is indeed happening even though our company has shut down. It's going to take more and more time, so I simply just need all of you to remain patient. It will be released before the Fall, I promise.
If I have any other information about the source code to add, I will dump it here.

Thanks everyone!!
